GrantedAuthority: 
---------------------------
GrantedAuthority is an interface in Spring Security that represents an authority granted to an Authentication object. 
It is typically used to represent roles or permissions assigned to a user.

SimpleGrantedAuthority:
------------------------------------
SimpleGrantedAuthority is a concrete implementation of the GrantedAuthority interface.
It is a simple class that wraps a String representing an authority (such as a role name).

In the context of Spring Security, GrantedAuthority and SimpleGrantedAuthority play a crucial role in managing user roles and permissions. Hereâ€™s how they function in your code:

Roles to Authorities Mapping:
------------------------------------------- 
The roles associated with a user are mapped to authorities (GrantedAuthority). 
This mapping is essential for Spring Security to understand what permissions or roles a user has.

Authority Representation:
--------------------------------------
SimpleGrantedAuthority is used to wrap each role name as an authority. 
This allows Spring Security to use these authorities when making access control decisions.
