You will see the RabbitMQ login screen. Type guest/guest

9. Under the RabbitMQ application. You can see `Channels` tab. Whenever the producer and consumer connect. That connection can be seen in
`Channels` tab.

10. Go to `Exchange` tab and for starters. we have to create a new exchange by clicking on the `Add a new exchange` tab.

11. Step 10 had been done. The exchange that had been created is called `exchange_demo`.

12. After creating an exchange in `Exchange` tab. Go and click on `Queue` tab and create a `queue`.

14. To create a queue click on `Add a new queue` tab.
14.1 Select the `Type` dropdown option as `Classic`.
14.2 Give the `Name` as `queue_demo`
14.3 Give the `Durability` dropdown option as `Durable`.
14.4 Give the `Auto delete` dropdown option as `No`
14.5 Click on `Add queue`.


15. Step 14 is already done ->`queue_demo`

16. After creating exchange and queue. We need to bind the exchange and queue.
16.1 Go to exchange tab and select the `exchange_demo` link. Go to `Bindings` tab to bind the exchange and queue.
16.2 Under the `To queue` dropdown option(this should be the selected option) type the queue name: `queue_demo`.
16.3 Under the `Routing key`, give the name as `routing_key_demo`.

So the basic ideas is we have to bind exchange `exchange_demo` and queue `queue_demo` with the Routing key `routing_key_demo`.
